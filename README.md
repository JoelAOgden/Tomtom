If you're reading this, this became a HUGE project
I imagine I have gone a little over board in the separation of things, but proper coding
practises say I have to :P (that's my excuse, the truth is I found it fun).
There are going to be a bunch of quick cheap sections of code (like using .get() on optionals)
simply because I have to choose two:

1. Building the perfect coding assignment. 
2. Having functional code.
3. Getting sleep :P.

Sadly I didn't have enough time at the point of writing this to implement a few things,
I will try to complete these before thursday either way.
