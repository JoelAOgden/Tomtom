If you're reading this, this became a much larger project then I suspected.

In order to get it functional in time I have had to cute a few corners.

I choose not to test the view or the user input. This has resulted in a seemingly 
lack of testing, everything important has tests but things like system input and output
is difficult to test and I felt it was more important to get things running and usable.

Sadly due to the gradle daemon not functioning with the console. You will need to run this
through your IDE. I will build the Jar to fix this asap.

Sadly I didn't have enough time at the point of writing this to implement a few things,
I will try to complete these before thursday either way.

    // TODO: set up java jar build properly (including gradle)
    // TODO: handle invalid input (instead of ignoreing)
    // TODO: create map pixelisation
    // TODO: draw map
    // TODO: create view console tests
    // TODO: clean the code a little bit
    // TODO: Do the TODOs
